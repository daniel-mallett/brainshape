# Welcome to Brain

Brain is your personal second-brain agent. It connects your markdown notes to a knowledge graph, giving an AI agent long-term memory and deep understanding of your notes.

## What can it do?

- **Read and search your notes** — the agent can find information across your notes using keyword and semantic search
- **Create and edit notes** — ask the agent to draft new notes or update existing ones
- **Remember things about you** — the agent stores memories in the knowledge graph and uses them to personalize responses
- **Explore connections** — see how your notes relate to each other through the graph visualization

## Getting started

Check out the tutorials to learn how Brain works:

- [[Getting Started]] — set up your notes and start chatting
- [[Writing Notes]] — learn about markdown, wikilinks, and tags
- [[Using the Agent]] — see what the AI agent can do for you

## Make it yours

Start by editing your [[About Me]] note — this helps the agent understand who you are and what you care about. The more context you give it, the more useful it becomes.
