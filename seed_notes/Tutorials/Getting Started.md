# Getting Started

This guide walks you through the basics of using Brain.

## The interface

Brain has three main areas:

- **Sidebar** — your file tree. Click any note to open it in the editor.
- **Editor** — a markdown editor with vim keybindings. Changes save automatically.
- **Chat** — your AI agent. Ask it anything about your notes or have it create new ones.

You can also switch between views using the buttons in the header:

- **Editor** — read and edit notes
- **Graph** — visualize connections between your notes
- **Memory** — see what the agent remembers about you

## Your first conversation

Try typing something in the chat panel:

- "What notes do I have?"
- "Summarize my Welcome note"
- "Create a note about a topic I'm interested in"

The agent can read your notes, search them, and create new ones — all through natural conversation.

## Next steps

- Edit your [[About Me]] note to personalize the agent
- Learn about [[Writing Notes]] to get the most out of your notes
- Explore [[Using the Agent]] to see what's possible
