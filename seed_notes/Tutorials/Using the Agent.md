# Using the Agent

The Brain agent is an AI assistant that has full access to your notes and knowledge graph. Here's what it can do.

## Searching your notes

The agent can find information across your notes:

- **"Search for notes about markdown"** — keyword search across titles and content
- **"Find notes similar to my Writing Notes"** — semantic search using meaning, not just keywords

## Reading and creating notes

Ask the agent to work with your notes directly:

- **"Read my About Me note"** — displays the full content
- **"Create a note about project ideas"** — writes a new note to your notes
- **"Update my About Me note with..."** — edits an existing note

## Exploring connections

The agent can query the knowledge graph:

- **"What notes are related to the Welcome note?"** — finds connections through tags and wikilinks
- **"Show me all notes tagged with tutorial"** — finds notes by tag

## Agent memory

The agent remembers things across conversations. It stores memories as nodes in the knowledge graph. You can:

- View memories in the **Memory** panel
- Edit or delete memories you don't want
- Add context to your [[About Me]] note for persistent personalization

## Tips for good results

- Be specific in your requests — "create a note about X" works better than "make a note"
- The agent reads your [[About Me]] note for context, so keep it updated
- Use the **Graph** view to see how the agent connects your notes
- Check the **Memory** panel periodically to see what the agent has learned about you
